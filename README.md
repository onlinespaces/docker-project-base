# docker-project-base
PHP-FPM, mySql, Redis, Nignx Docker Containers to start a project.

Currently, this project is geared towards symfony but can easily be modified
for other PHP type projects i.e. Drupal, Laravel, etc...

## Instructions
After cloning the project, rename .env.dev to .env and change any settings needed.

Coming soon ... I hope =)
